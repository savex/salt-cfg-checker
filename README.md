# salt-ci-packages
Gather packages installed on listed minions 
and create a fancy report with version comparison

# Notes
Be sure to 
 - create your *.env file 
   or supply environment vars to module other way
 - execute `salt-key` on master 
   and create an `etc/nodes.list` file with minions list

Cheers!
